### Introduction

A report describing the series as thoroughly as possible is generated thereafter. The aim of this report is to extract key information about the series so that the user can take good decisions about his data. The report analyses the series and starts by performing simple transformations and then does more advanced checks. The ultimate goal of this functionnality is to automatically define alert thresholds in order to answer anomaly detection problematics. In the annex of this report we can see a use case where we use the parameters extracted in the report to perform time series smoothing and to automatically detect anomalies. This report will ultimately serve for defining alerts in a simple and intuitive way.

### 1) Descriptive Analysis and Missing Values 

This time series represents the evolution of the number of `r name`. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot(ts, ylab = name)
```

It contains `r length(ts)` observations, going from `r as.POSIXct(data[1,1]/1000, origin="1970-01-01")` to `r as.POSIXct(data[length(data[,1]),1]/1000, origin="1970-01-01")`. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = (constant == TRUE)}
const <- unique(na.omit(data[,2]))
my_lag <- 1
```

`r if(constant == TRUE){paste0('The values of the time series are constant, all of them are equal to ', unique(na.omit(data[,2])), '. A constant series cannot be analyzed much more and so we end up the report here.')}`

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = (constant == FALSE)}
nas <- sum(is.na(ts))

if(nas == 0){
  chunki <- 'This time series does **not** contain any **missing values**, thus there is no need to make any interpolation.'
}

if (nas != 0){
  chunki <- paste('This time series contains ', nas, ' **missing values**. We will interpolate NAs linearly with the values that wrap the missing value. Missing values in the extremes of the series (first or last values) will be refilled with the closest point.')
  
  ts <- na.approx(ts, rule = 2)
}

min_ts <- round(min(ts), 3)
max_ts <- round(max(ts), 3)
mean_ts <- round(mean(ts), 3)
```

`r if (constant == FALSE){paste0('The time series contains values between ', min_ts, ' and ', max_ts, ' with a mean of ', round(mean_ts,3), '.', separator = '')}`

`r if (constant == FALSE){chunki}`

<!-- `r if (constant == FALSE){'We will normalize the series in order to have all values between 0 and 1. This will be useful when comparing it with other time series that have different units. We display the plot of the normalized series.'}` -->
